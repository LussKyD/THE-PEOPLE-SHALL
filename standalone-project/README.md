# Standalone Starter (No Dependencies)

This is a clean, dependency-free starter for a small standalone web project.
It is intentionally isolated from any existing project in the workspace.

## Quick Start

- Open `index.html` in your browser.
- Edit `styles.css` and `script.js` as needed.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` - Markup and content
- `styles.css` - Styling (light/dark themes)
- `script.js` - Small JS helpers (theme toggle)

## Notes

- This project has no build step or external dependencies.
- If you want a different tech stack, tell me the preferred language/framework.
