# Kids Constitution — Beginner Web App

This is a small, mobile-first web app prototype designed to teach school kids basic ideas about a constitution.
It is intentionally simple so you can upload everything to GitHub using only the GitHub web interface and host on GitHub Pages.

## What is included
- `index.html` — single-page app
- `styles.css` — lightweight styles
- `script.js` — navigation + quiz logic
- `manifest.json` — makes the site installable as a web app
- `icons/` — app icons
- `README.md` and `LICENSE` files

## How to use
See the step-by-step guide in the accompanying instructions document or the GitHub Pages guide I provide after you download the ZIP.
